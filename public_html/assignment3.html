			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The <em>USMCA (United-States Mexico and Canada agreement)</em> is the replacement for <em>NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement)</em>. It was replaced at request of the United States president who stated it was the <q>"worst trade deal ever"</q>. This revised agreement mentions many different different ways trade laws are changing however for this assignment I will only be mentioning the changes to <em>IP (Intellectual Property)</em> protections. Some of the topics that fall under intellectual property protections in the USMCA are:<p>

				<ul>
					<li>Further extension of copyright from life plus 50 years to life plus 70 years (Same as EU and US standards)</li>
					<li>Streaming and Piracy Enforcement</li>
					<li>ISP Safe Harboring</li>
					<li>Privacy Laws vs Data Retention and country access</li>
				</ul>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From what I have seen, many of the changes being made in the USMCA will have both positive and negative repercussions. For Canada, the USMCA brings a lot of change to the way intellectual property is protected. The USMCA also brings along a lot of changes for freedom of speech on the internet.<p>

			<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
		  The most controversial issue that came out about the USMCA was the 20 year extension of Copyright claims in Canada, from the copyright holders life plus 50 years to copyright holders life plus 70 years, with no copyright expiring until 2040. This extension brings us to the same standard that the US and EU are currently using. One of the good things about this policy is that it will allow the original creators to benefit from their creation for longer than before, giving them and their next of kin (or company) more money. However, as with everything in the USMCA there are two sides to this policy change. I believe this extension will give large companies longer to profit off of copyrights which should already be in public domain. This reduces the amount of Canadian made content that would be publicly available. This proves to be challenging for people who need access to copyrighted material for a paper but may not be able to afford the copyright fees associated. Micheal Geist wrote <q>"the term extension could add hundreds of millions to education costs"</q>, adding all of these additional costs will hamper Canada's history and cultural documents. Personally, I believe that Canada should stick with the current policy in place. The current life of creator plus 50 years is long enough for any person or company to extract enough value out of their copyrighted material before it expires. Once it expires, it should be released into the public domain for any Canadian to use or modify. My take on this issue is that limiting the amount of information accessible to Canadians will almost always have a negative affect on our society and that innovation comes with freedom.

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the USMCA comes improvements to Canada's counterfeit policy with the goal of reducing the amount of counterfeit content that travels through the borders as well as on the internet. One of the ways the USMCA aim to do this is by giving the <em>CBSA (Canadian Border Services Agency)</em> the authority to detain or destroy any package which contains either counterfeit or pirated content, currently CBSA officers have to file a Request for Assistance which can take a long time to process. However, this only applies to packages that are "in-transit", i.e. packages that are coming from outside of Canada with a final destination somewhere else than Canada, but pass through the CBSA's jurisdiction. Prior to the USMCA, Canadian border officials were prohibited from detaining any packages marked "in-transit". Most of these counterfeit "in transit" packages come from China who happens to be one of the countries we receive millions of imports from every year. This revision is a big win for IP owners globally, it will reduce the amount of counterfeit products that make their way into North America every year. However this change is not perfect, in fact it is one of the areas where most say the Canadian government "caved in" to the US. The reason being, the revision only specifically mentions packages with a final destination outside of Canada, meaning Canada is still left less protected than the US even though we have to spend the taxes to increase our border security. I like the way the USMCA is tackling this issue by providing CBSA officers with increased authority which will massively reduce the amount of counterfeit products brought into North America every year. The one change I would have liked to see is the addition of Canada into the agreement which would also allow the CBSA to halt counterfeit products with a final destination to Canada; without it, Canadian manufacturers will still be harmed by the counterfeit products that are brought over from China and the rest of Asia.
		  <p>

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The USMCA also attempted to reduce the amount of piracy and illegal streaming occurring in North America. According to an article by Variety illegal streaming and piracy will cost <q>"Netflix, Amazon and their streaming peers $50 billion between 2016 and 2022"</q>. Currently there are ways for copyright holders to track down users who <em>torrent</em> their show and informing their internet service provider, however a lot of media companies are completely unable to shutdown illegal streaming services, these services don't need users to directly download the content making it much harder for media companies to track down your IP. What these companies fail to realize is that most people turn to illegal streaming because there are not many legal ways to watch your favorite show online if it's not on Netflix. If I were able to change the USMCA I would create something similar to Netflix however it would be government run and companies could put their shows on the platform and request a fee of their choosing in order to watch the show. I believe that the only way to reduce piracy is to provide a better service.
			<p>

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of the revisions that meant a lot to me was Canada's first implementation
				of an <em>ISP (Internet Service Provider)</em> safe harbor law. This law protects ISPs from legal ramifications of what their users post online. Meaning that companies like Bell and Rogers are no longer being held liable for failing to remove third party content that their users (Their users being almost every Canadian with internet access) post online. These are Canada's first implementation of safe harbor laws, which will bolster free speech on the internet. Now thanks to the USMCA, if a company wants their illegally obtained content removed from a website they will have to go through a court and proper legal proceedings instead of threatening the ISPs with massive lawsuits, which in turn just create knee jerk reactions such as blocking web pages Canada wide. Cases like this have happened before when Bell almost went as far as to blocking access to many piracy sites to prevent being bogged down in lawsuits. This is also beneficial as it will bring people who want to invest in local servers now that there is no risk of them being liable for their users. The internet has the unique ability to give a voice to anyone with internet access, messages on the internet can reach farther than any other form of media. Personally I would support this law as I believe that free speech is the defining characteristic of the internet and without it the internet would lose it's creativity and innovation. China is a good example of what happens when free speech on the internet is suppressed; in China the government blocks a lot of western websites such as Google and YouTube. As a result Chinese people have created alternatives like Baidu and Youku which are essentially rip-offs. The Chinese government does all this in order to suppress the opposition and maintain their dictator like "democracy". This is why it is crucial that we enforce free speech on the internet by not holding the ISPs liable for it's users.

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every year, more and more of our data is being uploaded to the cloud meaning more and more of our data is moving out of our hard drives and into other people's servers this is a scary privacy problem that has been addressed in the USMCA. The main debate is about the flow of data between the United-States, Canada and Mexico in regards to what data should be able to freely travel and what data should remain in the originating country. Personally, I am a fan of keeping your data as close to you as possible, for example I believe that all of my school records should remain at locally at the Trent University campus. As of right now the law is that any critical or important information about us that the government has is required to be held in Canada within a Government of Canada approved facility. The goal of the USMCA in relation to data privacy reads

			<blockquote cite="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/experts-say-usmca-frees-canadian-data--but-with-unknown-risks/2018/10/03/3bdb05be-c651-11e8-9c0f-2ffaf6d422aa_story.html?utm_term=.5f79e26b02fb"> "No Party shall prohibit or restrict the cross-border transfer of information, including personal information," </blockquote>

			which on the surface seems like the goal is to allow freedom of data. However, this can actually work against all Canadians individual freedoms as this will allow certain three letter agencies in the United-States access to our data which used to be previously stored in Canada. However you could also argue that just server location alone does not prevent some of these people from having access to your personal data. The ability to have unrestricted data flow between the US and Canada will also allow smaller Canadian companies to store their data in cheaper US servers allowing for more tech growth in Canada and the US. I like the way that the USMCA deals with data privacy as it allows for a more open link between us and the United States. Canada is in need of more tech entrepreneurship and allowing data to flow freely and unrestricted between the two countries will help boost Canadian economy and innovation.

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The USMCA brings a lot of change to intellectual property protections with the intention of protecting North American by providing more protections related to the internet that were not as prominent when NAFTA was drafted. Some of these changes such as the extension of copyright claims by 20 years will have a negative effect on Canadians access to data by keeping it out of the public hands. However, most of these changes such as the ISP safe harbor laws, unrestricted data flow and piracy protection will be a great change for Canada and allow a more open and free (liberty) internet which is a necessity for technological innovation. I think it is important for all Canadians to become more aware with their digital footprint and what happens to the data they send out on the internet.
