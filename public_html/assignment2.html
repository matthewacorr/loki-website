			<figcaption class="formattedText"> This is the homepage for my app, it is for a mechanic in Peterborough. On the android variant I  added an ellipse  to the bottom which would allow the user to scroll down into the services tab allowing for a customer to quickly see our services. Also, all of our homepages have a "Call Us" button which would go directly to the dialer app with our phone number already inputted. The apple variant uses a navigation bar as per an option in Apple's human interface guidelines. For windows I use a side bar with quick navigation similar to many apps on the Microsoft Store </figcaption>

			<img src = "images/assignment2/Windows/Services.png" width = "40%" float = "true"></img>
			<figcaption class="formattedText"> For the services page I use a flat simple theme which has a list of the services we provide with short descriptions, however if you click on one of the services it will open a new page with further information and an option to add it to your cart. This screenshot also shows the difference between the platforms, android is using a hidden side menu with a button at the top right to access it, where as my IPhone app uses the highlight color on the navigation bar to display which active page you are on. On the Windows platform you can see my use of highlighting over mouse hover to indicate user interaction. I also used the native fonts on each platform, Android using Roboto, Apple is using Helvetica and Microsoft with Segoe UI. </figcaption>

			<img src = "images/assignment2/Windows/Login.png" width = "40%" float = "true"></img>
			<figcaption class="formattedText"> For each device I used text fields and buttons which were similar to ones that the designers use through the respective OS's. I also added a forgot password option as well as a way for new customers to register with us. On the desktop I took advantage of the extra screen real estate and allowed for an extra text field. </figcaption>

			<img src = "images/assignment2/Windows/Orders.png" width = "20%" float = "true"></img>
			<figcaption class="formattedText"> The orders were done similarly, all with an order number, quantity of each item, name of each item and then the total cost. The android and apple versions have slight formatting differences to suit more to the design guidelines of each platform. Prices are highlighted in green so they are easier to read at a glance. By clicking the arrow next to the order you would be able to read more information about the order and have a way to share it. </figcaption>

			<img src = "images/assignment2/Windows/Chat.png" width = "40%" float = "true"></img>
			<figcaption class="formattedText"> All of the chat pages are very similar, they have small search buttons which allow you to search through previous messages with a client. It allows the mechanic and the customer to have quick dialog about critical issues. The clients name is always on  the top of the screen and then a textbox at the bottom, the goal is to have an app that flows well on all platforms </figcaption>

			<img src = "images/assignment2/Windows/Social%20Media.png" width = "20%" float = "true"></img>
			<figcaption class="formattedText"> The social media pages allow you to browse all of your social medias at a glance, for a client using the app this would give them a convenient way to view all the other places they can reach you. If you sign in as an admin you would be able to add different social media platforms or provide emails. The colors of the numbers correspond to the icon of the app they are for to provide a bit of visual color patterns. </figcaption>
