			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For this assignment I decided to use the game Geometry Dash, for those who don't know, the game has only action which makes the character jump. When playing the game you can either use the space bar or a mouse click to make this jump. However, I do find the mouse to be more precise.</p>

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Geometry Dash the level's pace is set by the rhythm of the music. The beats in the song are used as an audio cue for when the player should jump. When making my level I chose a song which I thought would create a fast paced level. However, after each set of fast paced jumps I added a bit of breathing room so the player can recover themselves.</p>

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When creating the level, the editor provides some a line which shows when the beat will play in the game, as you can see in the screenshot below I attempted to align all of my jumps with the music. Which creates a really nice "flow" to the level.</p>

				<figcaption class="smallinfo">The green lines shows where the player should be and the yellow lines are the beats in the song.</a></figcaption>
				</center>
			</figure>

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In order to make sure the level doesn't get stale it was important that I created different challenges within the level. I added some spots which require either fast reaction times, or many attempts at the level. Near the end I included a gravity switch portal which causes the level's gravity to switch which can be very startling to the player. It is also important however that the level has a balance between being easy and being fun, if the level is too simple it takes away all of the excitement of finally beating it after a million attempts.</p>

			<p>Since Geometry Dash is a retry till you make it kind of game I wasn't able to add any "Easter eggs" or hidden rooms like you can in platform games. However I did add alternate paths that make the level easier if you are able to make the difficult jumps.</p>

			<p>The level editor is Geometry Dash is very complex and contains a lot of different styles of blocks, in order to keep a similar feel to my level I limited the amount of different colored blocks. I also attempted to match the feel of the vanilla Geometry Dash levels which contain bright colors.</p>
