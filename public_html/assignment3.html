			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The <em>USMCA</em> (United-States Mexico and Canada agreement) is the replacement for <em>NAFTA</em> (North American Free Trade Agreement). It was replaced at request of the United States president who stated it was the <i>"worst trade deal ever"</i>. This revised agreement mentions many different different ways trade laws are changing however for this assignment I will only be mentioning the changes to <em>IP</em> (Intellectual Property) protections. Some of the topics that fall under intellectual property protections are:<p>

			<ul>
				<li>Further extension of copyright from life plus 50 years to life plus 70 years (Same as EU and US standards)</li>
				<li>Streaming and Piracy Enforcement</li>
				<li>ISP Safe Harboring</li>
				<li>Privacy Laws vs Data Retention and country access</li>
			</ul>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From what I have seen, many of the changes being made in the USMCA will have both positive and negative repercussions. For Canada, it will allow us to enhance protections for Canadian entrepreneurs which in turn helps our economy. However some of the changes will be good for the United States yet detrimental to Canada. <p>

			<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The most controversial issue that came out about the USMCA was the 20 year extension of Copyright claims in Canada, from the copyright holders life plus 50 years to copyright holders life plus 70 years, with no copyright expiring until 2040. This extension brings us to the same standard that the US and EU are currently using. One of the good things about this policy is that it will allow the original creators to benefit from their creation for longer than before, giving them and their next of kin (or company) more money. However, as with everything in the USMCA there are two sides to this policy change. I believe this extension will give large companies longer to profit off of copyrights which should already be in public domain. This reduces the amount of Canadian made content that would be publicly available. This proves to be challenging for people who need access to copyrighted material for a paper but may not be able to afford the copyright fees associated. Micheal Geist wrote <i>"the term extension could add hundreds of millions to education costs"</i>, adding all of these additional costs will hamper Canada's history and cultural documents. Personally, I believe that Canada should stick with the current policy in place. The current life of creator plus 50 years is long enough for any person or company to extract enough value out of their copyrighted material before it expires. Once it expires, it should be released into the public domain for any Canadian to use or modify. My take on this issue is that limiting the amount of information accessible to Canadians will almost always have a negative affect on our society and that innovation comes with freedom.

			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the USMCA comes improvements to Canada's piracy and counterfeit policy with the goal of reducing the amount of pirated content that travels through the borders as well as on the internet. One of the ways the USMCA aim to do this is by giving the <em>CBSA</em> (Canadian Border Services Agency) the authority to detain or destroy any package which contains either counterfeit or pirated content, currently CBSA officers have to file a Request for Assistance which can take a long time to process. However, this only applies to packages that are <i>"in-transit"</i>, i.e. packages that are coming from outside of Canada with a final destination somewhere else than Canada, but pass through the CBSA's jurisdiction. Prior to the USMCA, Canadian border officials were prohibited from detaining any packages marked "in-transit". Most of these counterfeit "in transit" packages come from China who happens to be one of the countries we receive millions of imports from every year. This revision is a big win for IP owners globally, it will reduce the amount of counterfeit products that make their way into North America every year. However this change is not perfect, in fact it is one of the areas where most say the Canadian government <i>"caved in"</i> to the US. The reason being, the revision only specifically mentions packages with a final destination outside of Canada, meaning Canada is still left less protected than the US even though we have to spend the taxes to increase our border security. I like the way the USMCA is tackling this issue by providing CBSA officers with increased authority which will massively reduce the amount of counterfeit products brought into North America every year. The one change I would have liked to see is the addition of Canada into the agreement which would also allow the CBSA to halt counterfeit products with a final destination to Canada; without it, Canadian manufacturers will still be harmed by the counterfeit products that are brought over from China and the rest of Asia.
